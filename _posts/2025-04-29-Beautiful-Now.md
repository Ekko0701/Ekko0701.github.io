#### 가사


I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath itForgive me for staring, forgive me for breathingWe might not know why, we might not know howBut, baby, tonight we're beautiful now


We're beautiful nowWe're beautiful now


We might not know why, we might not know howBut, baby, tonight we're beautiful nowWe'll light up the sky; we'll open the clouds'Cause, baby, tonight we're beautiful now


We're beautifulWe're beautiful


Wherever it's going, I'm gonna chase itWhat's left of this moment, I'm not gonna waste itStranded together, our worlds have collidedThis won't be forever, so why try to fight it?


We're beautiful nowWe're beautiful now


We might not know why, we might not know howBut, baby, tonight we're beautiful nowWe'll light up the sky; we'll open the clouds'Cause, baby, tonight we're beautiful now


We're beautifulWe're beautiful


Let's live tonight like firefliesAnd one by one light up the skyWe disappear and pass the crownWe're beautiful; we're beautiful


We're beautiful nowWe're beautiful now (Beautiful)We're beautiful nowWe're beautiful now


We're beautifulWe're beautiful; we're beautiful now


We're beautiful nowWe're beautiful nowWe're beautiful nowWe're beautiful nowWe're beautiful
