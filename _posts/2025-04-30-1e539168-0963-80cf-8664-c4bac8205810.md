You call me
Oh, you call me all the time
You tell me
"ooh baby, yeah, you're mine"
I like it
When you draw all these smiles
I like it
But it's so many miles
I can't take just a fictional you
It's making me sad
Can't take just a picture of you
It's making me mad
I know it's a weekend or two
That I can't get past
I draw you
Oh, I draw you in my mind
Adore you
And your imaginary eyes
I saw you
But the details I can't find
Adore you
But it's starting to blur the lines
I can't take just the fictional you
It's making me sad
Can't take just a picture of you
It's making me mad
I know it's only a weekend or two
That I can't get past
```
